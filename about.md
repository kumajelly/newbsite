**Hey there! I’m Sean Ward**—part digital transformation guru, part artist, and all-around problem solver. By day, I specialize in making work life simpler, smarter, and smoother. Whether it’s helping teams adopt new tools, designing user-friendly workflows, or optimizing tech stacks, I bring a creative touch to the world of digital adoption and enablement.

But there’s more to me than meetings and metrics. As a former artist and art educator, I love bringing a spark of creativity to everything I do. When I’m not geeking out over new tech, you’ll probably find me exploring trails, running, or losing myself in a playlist of electronic beats.
